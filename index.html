                <p>
                    A web designer works on the appearance,layout,and,in some cases, 
                    content of a website. Appearance, for instance, relates to the colors,
                    font, and images used. Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized. 
                    A good web design is easy to use,aesthetically pleasing, and suit user group and brand of the website.Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity,so that no extraneous information and functionality that might distract or confuse users appears. As the keystone of a web designerâ€™s output is a site that wins and fosters the trust of the target audience, 
                    removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible is a consideration.

                    Back-end Development refers to the server-side development. It focuses on databases, scripting, website architecture. It contains behind-the-scene activities that occur when performing any action on a website. It can be an account login or making a purchase from an online store. Code written by back-end developers helps browsers to communicate with database information.
